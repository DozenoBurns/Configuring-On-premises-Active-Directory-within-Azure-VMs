<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to Deploy on-premises Active Directory within Azure Compute](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2025
- Windows 11 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Create a Resource Group
- Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)
  - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group
  - While creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnet
- Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM
  - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and Virtual Networkâ€”the Virtual Network MUST BE THE SAME.
  - Authentication type: Username/Password
- Ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network / Subnet
- End the lab
